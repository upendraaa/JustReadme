To run your PHP file on port 8080, you can use PHP's built-in web server. Here are the steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory that contains your PHP file.

2. Run the following command to start the PHP web server on port 8080:

   ```
   php -S localhost:8080
   ```

   This command starts the PHP web server and listens on port 8080 for incoming requests.

3. Open your web browser and go to the following URL:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/your-file.php
   ```

   Replace "your-file.php" with the name of your PHP file.

   This should open your PHP file in the web browser and run it on port 8080.

Note: Keep in mind that PHP's built-in web server is not intended for production use, and you should use a proper web server like Apache or Nginx for hosting your PHP application in production.
