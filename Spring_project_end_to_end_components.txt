BPMN (Camunda)
Business process model and notation
orchestrates complex business processes that 
span people, systems, and devices. With Camunda, 
business users collaborate with developers to model
and automate end-to-end processes using BPMN-powered
flowcharts, alongside DMN decision tables that promote speed, 
scale, and decision logic.
